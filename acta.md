# ACTA

## Abstracts

**Actor Action Object Meta** (ACTA) provides a humane way of representing Activities within a socially themed application. ACTA aims to deliver ease of understanding while maintaining clarity over REST implementations. It is a request protocol built for social networks. While it is possible to declare responses with ACTA, it is the engineer's free will.

## Introduction

ACTA is created out of a necessity to further streamline HTTP requests fitting modern social network applications. While REST is an excellent concept, much of the concept is dated back to 1995. ACTA is built with simple rules of thumb below (heavily inspired by Python):

- Less is More
- Complex is preferred than complicated

With the rules in mind, ACTA is designed to be implemented and understood quickly. An example of how simple ACTA is is represented below.

### Sending Message

Sending a message to another user is something that is common for any social network. Let's see how we can implement this with both REST and ACTA.

#### REST

`https://api.icehouse.com/messages/@john/team/chief/` - `POST`

```
+ Request
	{
		'message': 'Hello Chief!'
	}
```

```
import requests

requests.post('https://api.icehouse.com/messages/@john/team/chief/', data={'message': 'Hello Chief!'})
```

The URL above is an endpoint for John to send messages to his teammates. In this particular case, John wants to send a message to the user Chief. The HTTP method for this endpoint is of course POST.

#### ACTA

`https://api.icehouse.com/acta/` - `POST`

```
+ Request
	{
		'actor': {
			'type': 'user'
			'id': '@me'
		},
		'action': 523
		'object': {
			'type': 'message'
			'data': {
				'body': 'Hello Client!'
			}
		},
		'meta': {
			'data': {
				'to': 'chief'
			}
		}
	}
```

```
from acta import Acta, Verbs, Objects
import requests

req_body = Acta
			.actor(type=Objects.USER, 
				   id='@me')
			.action(Verbs.SEND)
			.object(type=Objects.MESSAGE,
					data=dict(body='Hello Client!'))
			.meta(data=dict(to='chief'))

requests.post('https://api.icehouse.com/acta', data=req_body)
```

In a glance it looks complex. The number of bytes being occupied is significantly more than the REST example. But, try typing in the Python codes.

### Retrieving a User Profile

Viewing a User Profile is basic to any social network. Let's see how we can do this with ACTA.

#### REST

`https://api.icehouse.com/user/john` - `GET`

```
import requests

requests.get('https://api.icehouse.com/user/john')
```

#### ACTA

`https://api.icehouse.com/acta` - `POST`

```
from acta import Acta, Verbs, Objects
import requests

req_body = Acta
			.actor(type=Objects.USER,
				   id='@me')
			.action(Verbs.VIEW)
			.object(type=Objects.USER_PROFILE,
					data=dict(to='john'))
requests.post('https://api.icehouse.com/acta', data=req_body)
```

## Specification

The specifics of ACTA are what governs how implementations should behave. When implementing ACTA, the only source of absolute truth is this document. Do not make any assumptions. There is only **one** true way for ACTA. Should any assumptions arises, raise as an Issue on Github.

Every ACTA request is routed through the use of JSON objects as the request body. This JSON **must** be formed by using Acta client libraries. Do not generate the JSON request body by hand.

### Terminology

Terminologies in ACTA are simple enough to only consists of **4** terms. The terms are detailed in the following sub-sections.
	
#### Actor

An actor is the subject of any activity. The type of an Actor must be a defined constant already defined with any Acta library. If it is not defined, implementers extend the library to suit to their needs. In no way should an implementation directly reference a value.

```
Code:
	Acta.actor(type=Objects.USER,
			   id='@me')
	
	Acta.actor(type=Objects.USER,
			   id='@anon')

Resulting JSON:
	{
		'actor': {
			'type': 23			// Objects.USER
			'id': '@me'
		}
	}
	
	{
		'actor': {
			'type': 23			// Objects.USER
			'id': '@anon'
		}
	}
```

##### Reserved Actor IDs

All reserved IDs are prefixed with `@`. Reserved Actor IDs are described below.

```
@anon
	This ID does not point to any object.

@me
	This ID points to the requesting user object's identity.

@friend
	This ID still does not point direcly to an object. But, from this ID we can 
	know that the requesting user is a friend of the mentioned ID.
```

#### Action

An action is the defining part of any ACTA request. Defining as in the relationship of actors and objects. Therefore we can build a graph of possible actions which will eventually validate ACTA requests.

It is mandatory that the all possible actions are predefined as **VERBS** and portrayed in an active sentence.

```
Code:
	Acta.action(Verbs.VIEW)

Resulting JSON:
	{
		'action': 42
	}
```

#### Object

An object is exactly the same as an actor. What differs is the relationships. All actors are objects and vice versa.

```
Code:
	Acta.objects(type=Objects.USER,
				 id='@me')
```

#### Meta

A meta object is the placeholder for anything and everything a request will require that are not represented as Actors, Actions or Objects. The structure of a meta object is arbitrary enabling a very flexible request structure for ACTA. Other than being flexible, ACTA is aimed to accommodate complex request structures.

Let's dive in into a rather complex request: search. I want to search for users with the name `batista`.

```
Code:
	Acta
		.actor(type=Objects.USER,
			   id='@me')
		.action(Verbs.SEARCH)
		.object(type=Objects.USER)
		.meta(data=dict(
			q='batista',
			offset=0,
			row=10
		))

Resulting JSON:
	{
		'actor': {
			'type': 'user'
			'id': '@me'
		},
		'action': 22
		'object': {
			'type': 'user'
		},
		'meta': {
			'data': {
				'q': 'batista',
				'offset': 0,
				'row': 10
			}
		}
	}
```
